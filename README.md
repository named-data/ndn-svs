# ndn-svs: State Vector Sync library for distributed realtime applications for NDN

This library implements the [State Vector Sync (SVS)](https://named-data.github.io/StateVectorSync/) protocol to synchronise state between multiple clients over NDN.

ndn-svs uses the [ndn-cxx](https://github.com/named-data/ndn-cxx) library.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* [ndn-cxx and its dependencies](https://named-data.net/doc/ndn-cxx/current/INSTALL.html)

### Build

To build ndn-svs from the source:

    ./waf configure
    ./waf
    sudo ./waf install

To build on memory constrained platform, please use `./waf -j1` instead of `./waf`. The
command will disable parallel compilation.

### Examples

To try out the demo CLI chat application:

    ./waf configure --enable-static --disable-shared --with-examples
    ./waf
    ./build/examples/chat <prefix>

Configure NFD to be multicast:

    nfdc strategy set <sync-prefix> /localhost/nfd/strategy/multicast
where `sync-prefix` is `/ndn/svs` for the example application.
